1. Introduction
---------------

This package  installs a  C language library  implementing a
template library.

  The  package makes  use of  the  GNU Autotools  and it  is
tested on a GNU+Linux system.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd cctemplate-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  From a repository checkout or  snapshot (the ones from the
Github site): we  may need to manually  run "libtoolize" the
first time, then  we must first run  the script "autogen.sh"
from the top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ sh autogen.sh

for  this  we need  to  have  installed the  GNU  Autotools:
Automake, Autoconf, Libtool.  After this:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/cctemplate

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/template

  After  the  installation  it  is possible  to  verify  the
installed library against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

A. Credits

exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.
